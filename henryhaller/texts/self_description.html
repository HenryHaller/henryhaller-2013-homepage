<h4>Intro;</h4>
<p>Hi, my name is Henry and welcome to my personal webspace. I've been an internet enthusiast since trying to hook up Age of Empires LAN connections in middle school. I decided to register this domain to show off some of my computer and coding skills, as well as use for personal projects. In June 2013 I graduated from McGill University where I majored in Political Science and minored in Economics. In addition to government and monetary policy I'm very focused on technologies that I think are changing the world but are also very accessible to everyday people such as myself, such as bitcoin and python programming in particular.</p>

<h4>Python, Web Development;</h4>
<p>I've been interested in programming since I realized how much computers were shaping our modern world and I've found that python is the language that best balances speed of development, speed of execution and has a huge range of functionality. It is my go-to language for computer projects of every complexity level. I consider myself strongly-intermediate with the language, and it's the main one I've used on my <a href="https://github.com/HenryHaller">Github Account</a> (a bit empty now but I hope to fill it up more soon). I've used python for several projects, including the website you're looking at right now. I prefer to focus on the back-end/database/functionality/server administration aspects rather than the front-end design part (css, javascript) but I can do that too, as I have for the site in front of you now, which I hope you find reasonably pleasing to the eye, or at least well-laid out. I also have an intermediate knowledge of MySQL.</p>

<p>In 2012, I used python/django (<a href="http://djangoproject.com">a python web framework</a>) to create a website for Corporate Case Simulation. Although it is now defunct, it was a sophisticated back-end that tracked assets, incomes, memos, news stories and directives for many simulated companies though simulated years. It had several levels of users so that participants ("directors" of the company) could draft directives which could be approved by the chair (a staff member) and would affect the incomes, fortunes and stock prices of their companies (controlled by another level of staff in response to the quality of directives submitted by participants). I'd be happy to give a reference upon request.</p>

<h4>Bluserve;</h4>
<p>My current project in python is setting up some software to turn a computer into a bluetooth music sink that can be controlled via a smartphone app. I've got most of the functionality working (I think), next I want to install it on a raspberry pi with a wifi/bluetooth dongle as an experimental product. I've ordered the raspberry pi + wifi dongle so working with that will be the next step and I'm very excited for it! I'll keep the project status updated on this site. <a href="https://github.com/HenryHaller/bluserve">Here's the source so far</a>. Warning: the code is still rather rudimentary, and I've only tested it on ubuntu 12.04. The smartphone app needs <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kivy.pygame&hl=en">Kivy Launcher</a> to work. But please do test it out if you want to, I'd love to hear your feedback!</p>

<h4>Bitcoin;</h4>
<p>If you're not familiar with what bitcoin is, I'm slightly jealous because right now you get to discover something new and exciting! In a nutshell, bitcoin is internet-style money. Jargon alert: It's a fully decentralized/distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that is impossible to counterfeit; its supply is limited, known and asymptotically increasing towards 21 million. If that sounds interesting to you, I recommend you check out <a href="http://bitcoin.org">bitcoin.org</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>. I've been following bitcoin since early 2011 so I can remember when its market cap was under $8 million, there were a handful of tweets about it total and the original client didn't even encrypt wallet files! (Yes I did search for "wallet.dat" in limewire but unfortunately there was no intersection between those foolish enough to index their entire harddrive and those savvy enough to be using bitcoin already.) How far we've come in a few years and I still think it's only gaining more momentum. I've been fascinated with it ever since, I'm also a big geek about cryptography in general though I can't pretend to understand most of the math involved, only the general theories and their practical applications. Bitcoin is a practical application that everyone can take advantage of, so download a client or make a web-wallet account (for example: <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>) and begin accepting bitcoin today.</p>

<h4>Startup Ambitions;</h4>
<p>I've had a couple of ideas in the past for start-ups, I've wanted to make a protocol for sending bitcoin through twitter through an intermediary bot, similar to the bitcointip bot on reddit if you're familiar with that. I also wanted to bring bitcoin to Africa through connecting it to the m-pesa system, or just going to Africa and buying bitcoin for local currency (probably kenyan shillings) in order to allow remittances to flow through bitcoin and thus avoid money transmission fees. (Also a good excuse to travel and get away from montreal's winter). I took a swahili class at McGill in fall 2012 and would like to go to Kenya or Tanzania some day. Now it seems that pikapay.com and kipochi.com are filling these niches, but that's ok, it just confirms to me that they were good ideas.</p>

<h4>Looking For Work;</h4>
<p>So now you know a bit about me; I'm a "hacker" with pretty good command line skills who can spend hours chiseling away at a solution if I know (or at least am pretty sure) that it exists somewhere, somehow. If you're interested in anything I've mentioned or are looking for a python guy to help glue the pieces of your project together, let me know. I'm based in Montreal, and am looking for cool projects to help out on. If you, or someone you know is looking for help with a website or linux administration, please don't hesitate to get in touch. My rates are very reasonable and negotiable. </p>
