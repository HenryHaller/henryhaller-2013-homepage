<h4>Bluserve;</h4>
<p>Bluserve is a project to bring quality bluetooth music playback to through linux devices.
 This is already possible with <a href="http://bluez.org">Bluez</a> and pulseaudio, but Bluserve aims to simplify the
 process and make it easy for any end-user to control via their smartphone.
 I've managed to get it running on a raspberry pi!. The smartphone app is also working, and in alpha/beta stage. Check back here for more updates!
