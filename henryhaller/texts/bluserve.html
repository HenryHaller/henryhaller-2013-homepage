<h4>Bluserve;</h4>
<p>Bluserve is a project to bring quality bluetooth music playback to Linux.
 This is already possible with <a href="http://bluez.org">Bluez</a> and pulseaudio, but Bluserve aims to simplify the process and make it easy for any end-user to control via their smartphone.
 My goal is to get it running on a raspberry pi. Check back here for more updates!
